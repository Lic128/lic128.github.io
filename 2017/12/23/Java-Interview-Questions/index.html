It does not have any element. This is unlike C/C++ where the first element by default is the program name.</p>
<h2 id="If-I-do-not-provide-any-arguments-on-the-command-line-them-the-String-array-of-Main-method-will-be-empty-or-null"><a href="#If-I-do-not-provide-any-arguments-on-the-command-line-them-the-String-array-of-Main-method-will-be-empty-or-null" class="headerlink" title="If I do not provide any arguments on the command line, them the String array of Main method will be empty or null?"></a>If I do not provide any arguments on the command line, them the String array of Main method will be empty or null?</h2><p>It is empty.

It will print 0. That means it is empty. But if it would have been null then it would have thrown a NullPointerException on attempting to print args.length.</p>
<h2 id="What-environment-variables-do-I-need-to-set-on-my-machine-in-order-to-be-able-to-run-Java-programs"><a href="#What-environment-variables-do-I-need-to-set-on-my-machine-in-order-to-be-able-to-run-Java-programs" class="headerlink" title="What environment variables do I need to set on my machine in order to be able to run Java programs?"></a>What environment variables do I need to set on my machine in order to be able to run Java programs?</h2><p>CLASPATH and PATH are the two variables.</p>
<h2 id="Can-an-application-have-multiple-classes-having-main-method"><a href="#Can-an-application-have-multiple-classes-having-main-method" class="headerlink" title="Can an application have multiple classes having main method?"></a>Can an application have multiple classes having main method?</h2><p>Yes it is possible. While starting the application we mention the class name to be run. The JVM will look for the Main method only in the class whose name you have mentioned. Hence there is not conflict amongst the multiple classes having main method.</p>
<h2 id="Can-I-have-multiple-methods-in-the-same-class"><a href="#Can-I-have-multiple-methods-in-the-same-class" class="headerlink" title="Can I have multiple methods in the same class?"></a>Can I have multiple methods in the same class?</h2><p>No the program fails to compile. The compiler says that the main method is already defined in the class.</p>
<h2 id="Do-I-need-to-import-java-lang-package-any-time-Why"><a href="#Do-I-need-to-import-java-lang-package-any-time-Why" class="headerlink" title="Do I need to import java.lang package any time? Why?"></a>Do I need to import java.lang package any time? Why?</h2><p>No. It is by default loaded internally by the JVM.</p>
<h2 id="Can-I-import-same-package-class-twice-will-the-JVM-load-the-package-twice-at-runtime"><a href="#Can-I-import-same-package-class-twice-will-the-JVM-load-the-package-twice-at-runtime" class="headerlink" title="Can I import same package/class twice? will the JVM load the package twice at runtime?"></a>Can I import same package/class twice? will the JVM load the package twice at runtime?</h2><p>one can import the same package or same class multiple times. Neither complier nor JVM complains about it. And the JVM will internally load the class only once no matter how many times you import the same class.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Checked-and-UnChecked-Exception"><a href="#What-are-Checked-and-UnChecked-Exception" class="headerlink" title="What are Checked and UnChecked Exception?"></a>What are Checked and UnChecked Exception?</h2><p>A checked exception is some subclass of Exception (or Exception itself), excluding class RuntimeException and its subclasses.<br>Making an exception checked forces client programmers to deal with the possibility that the exception will be thrown. eg, IOException thrown by java.io.FileInputStream’s read() method·<br>Unchecked exceptions are RuntimeException and any of its subclasses. Class Error and its subclasses also are unchecked. With an unchecked exception, however, the compiler doesn’t force client programmers either to catch the<br>exception or declare it in a throws clause. In fact, client programmers may not even know that the exception could be thrown. eg, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException thrown by String’s charAt() method· Checked exceptions must be caught at compile time. Runtime exceptions do not need to be. Errors often cannot be.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Overriding"><a href="#What-is-Overriding" class="headerlink" title="What is Overriding?"></a>What is Overriding?</h2><p>When a class defines a method using the same name, return type, and arguments as a method in its superclass, the method in the class overrides the method in the superclass. when the method is invoked for an object of the class, it is the new definition of the method that is called,and not the method definition from the superclass. Methods may be overridden to be more public, not more private.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-different-types-of-inner-classes"><a href="#What-are-different-types-of-inner-classes" class="headerlink" title="What are different types of inner classes?"></a>What are different types of inner classes?</h2><h3 id="Nested-top-level-classes-Member-classes-Local-classes-Anonymous-classes"><a href="#Nested-top-level-classes-Member-classes-Local-classes-Anonymous-classes" class="headerlink" title="Nested top-level classes, Member classes, Local classes, Anonymous classes."></a>Nested top-level classes, Member classes, Local classes, Anonymous classes.</h3><p>参考： <a href="https://www.jianshu.com/p/3ec6aa56fe6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">java中的四种内部类</a></p>
<h4 id="Nested-top-level-classes"><a href="#Nested-top-level-classes" class="headerlink" title="Nested top-level classes"></a>Nested top-level classes</h4><p>If you declare a class within a class and specify the static modifier, the compiler treats the class just like any other top-level class.</p>
<p>Any class outside the declaring class accesses the nested class with the declaring class name acting similarly to a package. eg, outer.inner. Top-level inner classes implicitly have access only to static variables. There can also be inner interfaces. All of these are of the nested top-level variety.</p>
<p>静态内部类也是定义在另一个类里面的类， 只不过在类的前面多了一个关键字static。 静态内部类是不需要依赖于外部类的， 这点和类的静态成员属性有点类似。并且它不能使用内部类的非static成员变量或者方法， 这点很好理解， 因为在没有外部类的对象的情况下， 可以创建静态内部类的对象， 如果允许访问外部类的非static成员就会产生矛盾， 因为外部类的非static成员必须依附于具体的对象。</p>

<h4 id="Member-classes"><a href="#Member-classes" class="headerlink" title="Member classes"></a>Member classes</h4><p>Member inner classes are just like other member methods and member variables and access to the member class is restricted, just like methods and variables. This means a public member classes acts  similarly to a nested top-level class. The primary difference between member classes and nested top-level classes is that member classes is that member classes have access to the specific instance of the enclosing class.</p>
<p>成员内部类， 就是作为外部类的成员， 可以直接使用外部类的所有成员和方法， 即使是private的。 同时外部类要访问内部类的所有成员变量/方法， 则需要通过内部类的对象来获取。</p>
<p>要注意的是， 成员内部类不能含有static的变量和方法。 因为成员内部类需要先创建了外部类， 才能创建它自己的。</p>
<p>在成员内部类要引用外部类对象时， 使用outer.this 来表示外部类对象； 创建内部类对象， 可以使用 outer.inner obj= outerobj. new innier();</p>

<h4 id="Local-classes"><a href="#Local-classes" class="headerlink" title="Local classes"></a>Local classes</h4><p>Local classes are like local variables, specific to a block of code. Their visibility is only within the block of their declaration. In order for the class to be useful beyond the declaration block, it would need to implement a more publicly available     interface.Because local classes are not members, the modifiers public, protected, private, and static are not usable.</p>
<p>局部内部类是定义在一个方法或者一个作用域里面的类， 它和成员内部类的区别在于局部内部类的访问仅限于方法内或者该作用域内。</p>

<p>接口是抽象方法的集合。 如果一个类实现了某个接口， 那么它就继承了这个接口的抽象方法。 这就像契约模式， 如果实现了这个接口， 那么就必须确保使用这些方法。 接口只是一种形式， 接口自身不能做任何事情。 以Externalizable接口为例：</p>

<h2 id="Describe-synchronization-in-respect-to-multithreading"><a href="#Describe-synchronization-in-respect-to-multithreading" class="headerlink" title="Describe synchronization in respect to multithreading."></a>Describe synchronization in respect to multithreading.</h2><p>With respect to multithreading, synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. Without synchronization, it is possible for one thread to modify a shared variables while another thread is in the process of using or updating same shared variable. This usually leads to significant errors.</p>
<h2 id="Explain-different-way-of-using-thread"><a href="#Explain-different-way-of-using-thread" class="headerlink" title="Explain different way of using thread?"></a>Explain different way of using thread?</h2><p>The thread could be implemented by using runnable interface or by inheriting from the Thread class. The former is more advantageous, ‘cause when you are going for multiple inheritance, the only interface can help.</p>
<h2 id="Difference-between-HashMap-and-HashTable"><a href="#Difference-between-HashMap-and-HashTable" class="headerlink" title="Difference between HashMap and HashTable?"></a>Difference between HashMap and HashTable?</h2><p>The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls. (HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas Hashtable doesnt allow). HashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time. HashMap is unsynchronized and Hashtable is synchronized.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-a-constructor-and-a-method"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-a-constructor-and-a-method" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between a constructor and a method?"></a>What is the difference between a constructor and a method?</h2><p>A constructor is a member function of a class that is used to create objects of that class. It has the same name as the class itself, has no return type, and is invoked using the new operator.<br>A method is an ordinary member function of a class. It has its own name, a return type (which may be void), and is invoked using the dot operator.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-an-Iterator"><a href="#What-is-an-Iterator" class="headerlink" title="What is an Iterator?"></a>What is an Iterator?</h2><p>Some of the collection classes provide traversal of their contents via a java.util.Iterator interface. This interface allows you to walk through a collection of objects, operating on each object in turn. Remember when using Iterators that they contain a snapshot of the collection at the time the Iterator was obtained; generally it is not advisable to modify the collection itself while traversing an Iterator.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-static-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-static-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is static in Java?"></a>What is static in Java?</h2><p>static means one per class, not one for each object no matter how many instance of a class might exist. This means that you can use them without creating an instance of a class. Static methods are implicitly final, because overriding is done based on the type of the object, and static methods are attached to a class, not an object. A static method in a superclass can be shadowed by another static method in a subclass, as long as the original method was not declared final. However, you can’t override a static method with a non-static method. In other words, you can’t change a static method into an instance method in a subclass.</p>
<p>Static methods can be overriden, but they cannot be overriden to be non-static,Whereas final methods cannot be overridden.</p>
<p>A static method is a method that’s invoked through a class, rather than a specific object of that class. Static methods can only access static variables – they can’t use anything that’s specific to a particular object. Nonstatic methods (or instance methods) must be called on a specific object and can use the object’s instance data.<br>A final method is just a method that cannot be overridden – while static methods are implicitly final, you might also want to create an final instance method.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-serialization"><a href="#What-is-serialization" class="headerlink" title="What is serialization?"></a>What is serialization?</h2><p>Serialization is a mechanism by which you can save the state of an object by converting it to a byte stream.</p>
<p>The serializable interface is an empty interface. It does not contain any methods. So we do not implement ant methods.</p>

Moreover if the state of an object is to be saved, objects need to be serialized.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-wrapper-classes"><a href="#What-are-wrapper-classes" class="headerlink" title="What are wrapper classes?"></a>What are wrapper classes?</h2><p>java provides specialized classes corresponding to each of the primitive data types. These are called wrapper classes. They are e.g. Integer, Character, Double etc.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-different-ways-to-handle-exceptions"><a href="#What-are-the-different-ways-to-handle-exceptions" class="headerlink" title="What are the different ways to handle exceptions?"></a>What are the different ways to handle exceptions?</h2><p> There are two ways to handle exceptions, </p>
<ol>
<li>By wrapping the desired code in a try block followed by a catch block to catch the exceptions.</li>
<li>Lit the desired exceptions in the throws clause of the method and let the caller of the method handle those exceptions.</li>
</ol>

It should be followed by either a catch block or a finally block. And whatever exceptions are likely to be thrown should be declared in the throws clause if the method.</p>

The finally block will execute and then the control system.</p>

If you try to use these variables without initializing them explicitly, the java compiler will not compile the code. It will complain abt the local variable not being initialized.</p>
<h2 id="Can-we-Overload-main-method"><a href="#Can-we-Overload-main-method" class="headerlink" title="Can we Overload main() method?"></a>Can we Overload main() method?</h2><p>Yes. We can overload main() method. A java class can have any number of main() methods. But to run the java class. class should have main() method with signature as “public static void main(String[] args)”. If you do any modification to this signature, compilation will be successful. But, you can’t run the java program. You will get run time error as main method not found.</p>
<h2 id="Can-we-declare-main-method-as-private-or-protected-or-with-no-access-modifier"><a href="#Can-we-declare-main-method-as-private-or-protected-or-with-no-access-modifier" class="headerlink" title="Can we declare main() method as private or protected or with no access modifier?"></a>Can we declare main() method as private or protected or with no access modifier?</h2><p>No, main() method must be public. You can’t define main() methods as private or protected or with no access modifier. This is because to make the main()  method accessible to JVM. If you define main() method other than public, compilation will be successful but you will get run time error as no main method found.</p>
<h2 id="Can-we-Declare-main-Method-As-Non-Static"><a href="#Can-we-Declare-main-Method-As-Non-Static" class="headerlink" title="Can we Declare main() Method As Non-Static?"></a>Can we Declare main() Method As Non-Static?</h2><p>No, main() method must be declared as static so than JVM can call main() method without instantiating it’s class. If you remove “static” from main() method signature, compilation will be successful but program fails at run time.</p>
<h2 id="Can-we-change-return-type-of-main-method"><a href="#Can-we-change-return-type-of-main-method" class="headerlink" title="Can we change return type of main() method?"></a>Can we change return type of main() method?</h2><p>No. The return type of main() method must be void only. Any other type is not acceptable.</p>

But, there are some scenarios like if super class has main() method. then sub class can be run without defining main() method in it. </p>
<h3 id="What-is-Thread-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-Thread-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What  is Thread in Java?"></a>What  is Thread in Java?</h3><p>The thread is an independent path of execution. It’s way to take advantage of multiple CPU available in a machine.  By employing multiple threads you can speed up CPU bound task. For example, if one thread takes 100 milliseconds to do a job, you can use 10 threads to reduce that task into 10 milliseconds. Java provides excellent support for multithreading at the language level, and it’s one of the strong selling points.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-Thread-and-Process-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-Thread-and-Process-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between Thread and Process in Java?"></a>What is the difference between Thread and Process in Java?</h3><p>The thread is a subset of Process, in other words, one process can contain multiple threads. Two process runs on different memory space, but all threads share same memory space. Don’t confuse this with stack memory, which is different for the different thread and used to store local data to that thread. </p>
<h3 id="How-do-you-implement-Thread-in-Java"><a href="#How-do-you-implement-Thread-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="How do you implement Thread in Java?"></a>How do you implement Thread in Java?</h3><p>At the language level, there are two ways to implement Thread in Java. An instance of java.lang.Thread represent a thread but it needs a task to execute, which is an instance of interface java.lang.Runnable. Since Thread class itself implement Runnable, you can override run() method by extending Thread class or just implementing Runnable interface. </p>
<h3 id="When-to-use-Runnable-vs-Thread-in-Java"><a href="#When-to-use-Runnable-vs-Thread-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="When to use Runnable vs Thread in Java?"></a>When to use Runnable vs Thread in Java?</h3><p>This question will be easy to answer if you know that Java programming language doesn’t support multiple inheritances of class, but it allows you to implement multiple interfaces. Which means, it’s better to implement Runnable then extends Thread if you also want to extend another class. </p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-start-and-run-method-of-Thread-class"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-start-and-run-method-of-Thread-class" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between start() and run() method of Thread class?"></a>What is the difference between start() and run() method of Thread class?</h3><p>start() method is used to start newly created thread, while start() internally calls run()  method, there is difference calling run() method directly. When you invoke run() as normal method, it’s called in the same thread, no new thread is started, which is the case when you call start() method.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-Runnable-and-Callable-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-Runnable-and-Callable-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between Runnable and Callable in Java?"></a>What is the difference between Runnable and Callable in Java?</h3><p>Both Runnable and Callable represent task which is intended to be executed in a separate thread. Runnable is there from JDK 1.0 while Callable was added on JDK 1.5. Main difference between these two is that Callable’s call() method can return value and throw Exception, which was not possible with Runnable’s run() method. Callable return Future object, which can hold the result of computation. See my <a href="http://java67.blogspot.com/2013/01/difference-between-callable-and-runnable-java.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the same topic for a more in-depth answer to this question.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-CyclicBarrier-and-CountDownLatch-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-CyclicBarrier-and-CountDownLatch-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch in Java?"></a>What is the difference between CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch in Java?</h3><p>Though both CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch wait for number of threads on one or more events, the main difference between them is that you can not re-use CountDownLatch once count reaches to zero, but you can reuse same CyclicBarrier even after barrier is broken.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-volatile-variable-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-volatile-variable-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is volatile variable in Java?"></a>What is volatile variable in Java?</h3><p>volatile is a special modifier, which can only be used with instance variables. In concurrent Java programs, changes made by multiple threads on instance variables is not visible to other in absence of any synchronizers e.g. synchronized  keyword or locks. Volatile variable guarantees that a write will happen before any subsequent read: as stated:”volatile variable rule”.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-thread-safety-is-a-Vector-a-thread-safe-class"><a href="#What-is-thread-safety-is-a-Vector-a-thread-safe-class" class="headerlink" title="What is thread-safety? is a Vector a thread-safe class?"></a>What is thread-safety? is a Vector a thread-safe class?</h3><p>Thread-safety is a property of an object or code which guarantees that if executed or used by multiple threads in any manner. For example, a thread-safe counter object will not miss any count if same instance of that counter is shared among multiple threads. Apparently, you can also divide collection classes in two category, thread-safe and non-thread-safe. Vector is indeed a thread-safe class and it achieves thread-safety by synchronizing methods which modify state of Vector, on the other hand, its counterpart ArrayList is not thread-safe.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-stop-a-thread-in-Java"><a href="#How-to-stop-a-thread-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="How to stop a thread in Java?"></a>How to stop a thread in Java?</h3><p>I always said that Java provides rich APIs for everything but ironically Java doesn’t provide a sure shot way of stopping thread. There was some control methods in JDK 1.0 e.g. stop(), suspend() and resume() which was deprecated in later releases due to potential deadlock threats, from then Java API designers has not made any effort to provide a consistent, thread-safe and elegant way to stop threads. Programmers mainly rely on the fact that thread stops automatically as soon as they finish execution of run() or call() method. To manually stop, programmers either take advantage of volatile boolean variable and check in every iteration if run method has loops or interrupt threads to abruptly cancel tasks. See this <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-to-stop-thread-java-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a> for sample code of stopping thread in Java.</p>
<h3 id="What-happens-when-an-Exception-occurs-in-a-thread"><a href="#What-happens-when-an-Exception-occurs-in-a-thread" class="headerlink" title="What happens when an Exception occurs in  a thread?"></a>What happens when an Exception occurs in  a thread?</h3><p>This is one of the good <a href="http://java67.blogspot.sg/2012/09/top-10-tricky-java-interview-questions-answers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tricky Java question</a> I have seen in interviews. In simple words, If not caught thread will die, if an uncaught exception handler is registered then it will get a call back. Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler is an interface, defined as nested interface for handlers invoked when a Thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception. When a thread is about to terminate due to an uncaught exception the Java Virtual Machine will query the thread for its UncaughtExceptionHandler using Thread.getUncaughtExceptionHandler() and will invoke the handler’s uncaughtException() method, passing the thread and the exception as arguments.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-notify-and-notifyAll-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-notify-and-notifyAll-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between notify and notifyAll in Java?"></a>What is the difference between notify and notifyAll in Java?</h3><p>This is another tricky questions from core Java interviews, since multiple threads can wait on single monitor lock, Java API designer provides method to inform only one of them or all of them, once waiting condition changes, but they provide half implementation. There notify() method doesn’t provide any way to choose a particular thread, that’s why its only useful when you know that there is only one thread is waiting. On the other hand, notifyAll() sends notification to all threads and allows them to compete for locks, which ensures that at-least one thread will proceed further. See my <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/10/difference-between-notify-and-notifyall-java-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on similar topic for a more detailed answer and code example.</p>
<h3 id="Why-wait-notify-and-notifyAll-are-not-inside-thread-class"><a href="#Why-wait-notify-and-notifyAll-are-not-inside-thread-class" class="headerlink" title="Why wait, notify and notifyAll are not inside thread class?"></a>Why wait, notify and notifyAll are not inside thread class?</h3><p>This is a design related question, which checks what candidate thinks about existing system or does he ever thought of something which is so common but looks in-appropriate at first. In order to answer this question, you have to give some reasons why it make sense for these three method to be in Object class, and why not on Thread class. One reason which is obvious is that Java provides lock at object level not at thread level. Every object has lock, which is acquired by thread. Now if thread needs to wait for certain lock it make sense to call wait() on that object rather than on that thread. Had wait() method declared on Thread class, it was not clear that for which lock thread was waiting. In short, since wait, notify and notifyAll operate at lock level, it make sense to defined it on object class because lock belongs to object.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-ThreadLocal-variable-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-ThreadLocal-variable-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is ThreadLocal variable in Java?"></a>What is ThreadLocal variable in Java?</h3><p>ThreadLocal variables are special kind of variable available to Java programmer. Just like instance variable is per instance, ThreadLocal variable is per thread. It’s a nice way to achieve thread-safety of expensive-to-create objects, for example you can make SimpleDateFormat thread-safe using ThreadLocal. Since that class is expensive, its not good to use it in local scope, which requires separate instance on each invocation. By providing each thread their own copy, you shoot two birds with one arrow. First, you reduce number of instance of expensive object by reusing fixed number of instances, and Second, you achieve thread-safety without paying cost of synchronization or immutability. Another good example of thread local variable is ThreadLocalRandom class, which reduces number of instances of expensive-to-create Random object in multi-threading environment. See this <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2012/05/how-to-use-threadlocal-in-java-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer</a> to learn more about thread local variables in Java.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-FutureTask-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-FutureTask-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is FutureTask in Java?"></a>What is FutureTask in Java?</h3><p>FutureTask represents a cancellable asynchronous computation in concurrent Java application. This class provides a base implementation of Future, with methods to start and cancel a computation, query to see if the computation is complete, and retrieve the result of the computation. The result can only be retrieved when the computation has completed; the get methods will block if the computation has not yet completed. A FutureTask object can be used to wrap a Callable or Runnable object. Since FutureTask also implements Runnable, it can be submitted to an Executor for execution.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-the-interrupted-and-isInterrupted-method-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-the-interrupted-and-isInterrupted-method-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between the interrupted() and isInterrupted() method in Java?"></a>What is the difference between the interrupted() and isInterrupted() method in Java?</h3><p>Main difference between interrupted() and isInterrupted() is that former clears the interrupt status while later does not. The interrupt mechanism in Java multi-threading is implemented using an internal flag known as the interrupt status. Interrupting a thread by calling Thread.interrupt() sets this flag. When interrupted thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the <a href="http://java67.blogspot.com/2012/11/what-is-static-class-variable-method.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static method</a> Thread.interrupted(), interrupt status is cleared. The non-static isInterrupted() method, which is used by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the interrupt status flag. By convention, any method that exits by throwing an InterruptedException clears interrupt status when it does so. However, it’s always possible that interrupt status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking interrupt</p>
<h3 id="Why-wait-and-notify-method-are-called-from-synchronized-block"><a href="#Why-wait-and-notify-method-are-called-from-synchronized-block" class="headerlink" title="Why wait and notify method are called from synchronized block?"></a>Why wait and notify method are called from synchronized block?</h3><p>Main reason for calling wait and notify method from either synchronized block or method is that it made mandatory by Java API. If you don’t call them from synchronized context, your code will throw IllegalMonitorStateException. A more subtle reason is to avoid the race condition between wait and notify calls.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-synchronized-and-concurrent-collection-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-synchronized-and-concurrent-collection-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between synchronized and concurrent collection in Java?"></a>What is the difference between synchronized and concurrent collection in Java?</h3><p>Though both synchronized and concurrent collection provides thread-safe collection suitable for multi-threaded and concurrent access, later is more scalable than former. Before Java 1.5, Java programmers only had synchronized collection which becomes source of contention if multiple thread access them concurrently, which hampers scalability of system. Java 5 introduced concurrent collections like ConcurrentHashMap, which not only provides thread-safety but also improves scalability by using modern techniques like lock stripping and partitioning internal table.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-Stack-and-Heap-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-Stack-and-Heap-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between Stack and Heap in Java?"></a>What is the difference between Stack and Heap in Java?</h3><p>Why does someone this question as part of multi-threading and concurrency? because Stack is a memory area which is closely associated with threads. To answer this question, both stack and heap are specific memories in Java application. Each thread has their own stack, which is used to store local variables, method parameters and call stack. Variable stored in one Thread’s stack is not visible to other. On another hand, the heap is a common memory area which is shared by all threads. Objects whether local or at any level is created inside heap. To improve performance thread tends to cache values from heap into their stack, which can create problems if that variable is modified by more than one thread, this is where volatile variables come into the picture. volatile suggest threads read the value of variable always from main memory. </p>
<h3 id="What-is-thread-pool-Why-should-you-thread-poll-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-thread-pool-Why-should-you-thread-poll-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is thread pool? Why should you thread poll in Java?"></a>What is thread pool? Why should you thread poll in Java?</h3><p>Creating thread is expensive in terms of time and resource. If you create thread at time of request processing it will slow down your response time, also there is only a limited number of threads a process can create. To avoid both of these issues, a pool of thread is created when application starts-up and threads are reused for request processing. This pool of thread is known as “thread pool” and threads are known as worker thread. From JDK 1.5 release, Java API provides Executor framework, which allows you to create different types of thread pools e.g. single thread pool, which process one task at a time, fixed thread pool (a pool of fixed number of threads) or cached thread pool (an expandable thread pool suitable for applications with many short lived tasks).</p>

There is a method called holdsLock() on java.lang.Thread, it returns true if and only if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified object. </p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-synchronized-and-ReentrantLock-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-synchronized-and-ReentrantLock-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock in Java?"></a>What is the difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock in Java?</h3><p>There were days when the only way to provide mutual exclusion in Java was via synchronized keyword, but it has several shortcomings e.g. you can not extend lock beyond a method or block boundary, you can not give up trying for a lock etc. Java 5 solves this problem by providing more sophisticated control via Lock interface. ReentrantLock is a common implementation of Lock interface and provides re-entrant mutual exclusion Lock with the same basic behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using synchronized methods and statements, but with extended capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="There-are-three-threads-T1-T2-and-T3-How-do-you-ensure-sequence-T1-T2-T3-in-Java"><a href="#There-are-three-threads-T1-T2-and-T3-How-do-you-ensure-sequence-T1-T2-T3-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="There are three threads T1, T2 and T3?  How do you ensure sequence T1, T2, T3 in Java?"></a>There are three threads T1, T2 and T3?  How do you ensure sequence T1, T2, T3 in Java?</h3><p>Sequencing in multi-threading can be achieved by different means but you can simply use the join() method of thread class to start a thread when another one has finished its execution. To ensure three threads execute you need to start the last one first e.g. T3 and then call join methods in reverse order e.g. T3 calls T2. join and T2 calls T1.join, these ways T1 will finish first and T3 will finish last.</p>
<h3 id="What-does-yield-method-of-Thread-class-do"><a href="#What-does-yield-method-of-Thread-class-do" class="headerlink" title="What does yield method of Thread class do?"></a>What does yield method of Thread class do?</h3><p>Yield method is one way to request current thread to relinquish CPU so that other thread can get a chance to execute. Yield is a static method and only guarantees that current thread will relinquish the CPU but doesn’t say anything about which other thread will get CPU. Its possible for the same thread to get CPU back and start its execution again.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-Semaphore-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-Semaphore-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is Semaphore in Java?"></a>What is Semaphore in Java?</h3><p>Semaphore in Java is a new kind of synchronizer. It’s a counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits. Each acquire() blocks if necessary until a permit is available, and then takes it. Each release() adds a permit, potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. However, no actual permit objects are used; the Semaphore just keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly. Semaphore is used to protect an expensive resource which is available in fixed number e.g. database connection in the pool.</p>
<h3 id="What-happens-if-you-submit-a-task-when-the-queue-of-the-thread-pool-is-already-filled"><a href="#What-happens-if-you-submit-a-task-when-the-queue-of-the-thread-pool-is-already-filled" class="headerlink" title="What happens if you submit a task when the queue of the thread pool is already filled?"></a>What happens if you submit a task when the queue of the thread pool is already filled?</h3><p>This is another tricky question on my list. Many programmers will think that it will block until a task is cleared but its true. ThreadPoolExecutor’s submit() method throws RejectedExecutionException if the task cannot be scheduled for execution.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-the-submit-and-execute-method-thread-pool-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-the-submit-and-execute-method-thread-pool-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between the submit() and execute() method thread pool in Java?"></a>What is the difference between the submit() and execute() method thread pool in Java?</h3><p>Both methods are ways to submit a task to thread pools but there is a slight difference between them. execute(Runnable command) is defined in Executor interface and executes given task in future, but more importantly, it does not return anything. Its return type is void. On other hand submit() is an overloaded method, it can take either Runnable or Callable task and can return Future object which can hold the pending result of computation. This method is defined on ExecutorService interface, which extends Executor interface, and every other thread pool class e.g. ThreadPoolExecutor or ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor gets these methods.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-ReadWriteLock-in-Java"><a href="#What-is-ReadWriteLock-in-Java" class="headerlink" title="What is ReadWriteLock in Java?"></a>What is ReadWriteLock in Java?</h3><p>In general, read write lock is the result of lock stripping technique to improve the performance of concurrent applications. In Java, ReadWriteLock is an interface which was added in Java 5 release. A ReadWriteLock maintains a pair of associated locks, one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads, so long as there are no writers. The write lock is exclusive. If you want you can implement this interface with your own set of rules, otherwise you can use ReentrantReadWriteLock, which comes along with JDK and supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks and 65535 read locks.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-the-volatile-and-atomic-variable-in-java"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-the-volatile-and-atomic-variable-in-java" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between the volatile and atomic variable in java?"></a>What is the difference between the volatile and atomic variable in java?</h3><p>This is an interesting question for Java programmer, at first, volatile and atomic variable look very similar, but they are different. Volatile variable provides you happens-before guarantee that a write will happen before any subsequent write, it doesn’t guarantee atomicity. For example count++ operation will not become atomic just by declaring count variable as volatile. On the other hand AtomicInteger class provides atomic method to perform such compound operation atomically e.g. getAndIncrement() is atomic replacement of increment operator. It can be used to atomically increment current value by one. Similarly you have atomic version for other data type and reference variable as well.</p>
<h3 id="What-happens-if-a-thread-throws-an-Exception-inside-synchronized-block"><a href="#What-happens-if-a-thread-throws-an-Exception-inside-synchronized-block" class="headerlink" title="What happens if a thread throws an Exception inside synchronized block?"></a>What happens if a thread throws an Exception inside synchronized block?</h3><p>This is one more tricky question for average Java programmer, if he can bring the fact about whether lock is released or not is a key indicator of his understanding. To answer this question, no matter how you exist synchronized block, either normally by finishing execution or abruptly by throwing exception, thread releases the lock it acquired while entering that synchronized block. This is actually one of the reasons I like synchronized block over lock interface, which requires explicit attention to release lock, generally this is achieved by releasing the lock in a <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/11/difference-between-final-finally-and-finalize-java.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally block</a>.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-difference-between-calling-wait-and-sleep-method-in-Java-multi-threading"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-calling-wait-and-sleep-method-in-Java-multi-threading" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between calling wait() and sleep() method in Java multi-threading?"></a>What is the difference between calling wait() and sleep() method in Java multi-threading?</h3><p>Though both wait and sleep introduce some form of pause in Java application, they are the tool for different needs. Wait method is used for inter-thread communication, it relinquishes lock if waiting for a condition is true and wait for notification when due to an action of another thread waiting condition becomes false. On the other hand sleep() method is just to relinquish CPU or stop execution of current thread for specified time duration. Calling sleep method doesn’t release the lock held by the current thread. </p>
